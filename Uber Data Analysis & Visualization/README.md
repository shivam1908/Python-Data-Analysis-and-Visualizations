# Uber_NewYork_Data_Analysis
This project is an analysis of the 'Uber Pickups in NYC' dataset. 

Throughout the project, various questions regarding the Uber pickup-trends in and around New York have been answered which can be
used to gain insights into the customer behaviour and demands and subsequently make changes to their business model accordingly to serve
them better.

In the analysis, some of the questions that have been answered are given below:

1. Which day of the week witnesses maximum rush for pickups, and at what time?
2. At what time during the day is the rush maximum?
3. Which places in and around New York have high pickup rates?
4. What is the demand versus supply chart of uber pickups in NYC?

The results have been effectively visualized.

All the files are as they were received on August 3, Sept. 15 and Sept. 22, 2015.

The dataset contains, roughly, four groups of files:

Uber trip data from 2015 (January - June), with less fine-grained location information
non-Uber FHV (For-Hire Vehicle) trips. The trip information varies by company, but can include day of trip, time of trip, pickup location, driver's for-hire license number, and vehicle's for-hire license number.
aggregate ride and vehicle statistics for all FHV companies (and, occasionally, for taxi companies)
